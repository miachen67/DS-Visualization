# Data Structures Visualization

This website assists in visualizing the add, remove, find etc. methods/operations for ArrayLists, Stacks, Queues. 

For arrays, to start, select a method: add, remove or find. I would recommend adding some elements to the array first! 
## Add
1. Click Add.
2. Input a number. This will be the integer added to your ArrayList.
3. Specify the index you would like to add the integer at. The index can be `0 to len(array)`

## Remove
1. Click Remove.
2. Input an index. This will be the index that an element is removed from. The index can be `0 to len(array)-1`

## Find
1. Click Find.
2. Input a number. This will be the integer we are looking for.
